# Pytorch Neural Networks
In this section, I use custom and built-in PyTorch methods to build non-linear regression models.

## A non-linear (custom) Pytorch Neural Network
I build a custom non-linear pytorch neural network from scratch, having a 3-layer deep network, for linear regression 

> In this section, PyTorch built-in layer functionality will not be used.

 
## A non-linear (classes-based) Pytorch Neural Network
I build pytorch classes based - 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression using pytorch builtin functionality of modules etc.,. backprop etc.,.


## A non-linear (classes-based) Pytorch Lightning Neural Network
A colab  pytorch lightening version of a classes based - 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression using pytorch builtin functionality of modules etc.,. backprop etc.,.
