## Numpy Neural Network
### A non-linear (custom) Numpy Neural Network
I build a numpy only model having a 3-layer deep network for non linear regression. I'll be using a non linear activation function and identifying the proper number of hidden layer neurons by evaluating the results (loss and epochs training, prediction output). Also, manual backprop and chain rule based gradient propagation will be used.

This model is applied on a set of features within a dataset of environmental safeguard variables commonly used to assess the economic cost of doing buisness on the environment. The target variable is a percentage that defines whether the economic cost of the company has gone down or up as a ratio of their total revenue. For example, a high economic cost and a low revenue will result in a larger ratio & vice versa.
