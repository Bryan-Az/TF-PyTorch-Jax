## Numpy Neural Network
### A non-linear (custom) Numpy Neural Network
I build a numpy only model having a 3-layer deep network for non linear regression. I'll be using a non linear activation function and identifying the proper number of hidden layer neurons by evaluating the results (loss and epochs training, prediction output). 

In this section, manual backprop and chain rule based gradient propagation will be used.
