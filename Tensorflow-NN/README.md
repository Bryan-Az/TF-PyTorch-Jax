# Tensorflow Neural Networks

## Tensorflow High-Level (class-based) API Networks

### A linear Tensorflow Neural Network
A 3 layer deep neural network using matrix multiply.

### A non-linear Tensorflow Neural Network
A 3 layer deep neural network using tensorflow einsum instead of matrix multiply. 3 variables will be using in the non linear equation. Synthetically generated data will be processed with the non-linear equation and plotted using a 4d plot.

### A non-linear (custom) Numpy Neural Network
I build a numpy only model having a 3-layer deep network for non linear regression. I'll be using a non linear activation function and identifying the proper number of hidden layer neurons by evaluating the results (loss and epochs training, prediction output). 

> In this section, manual backprop and chain rule based gradient propagation will be used.

### Tensorflow Low-Level (custom) API Network

In this section I built a Tensorflow model built using the low level (functional) api.
