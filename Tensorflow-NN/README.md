# Tensorflow Neural Networks

## Tensorflow Low-Level (custom) API Network using Matrix Multiply
In this section I built a Tensorflow model using the low level (functional/keras) api. A 3 layer deep non-linear Tensorflow neural network using a simple matrix multiplication in the custom forward method. 3 variables will be used in the non linear equation. Synthetically generated data will be created using the mean and variance of the distribution in the environmental data corpsplit, and then used to train and test the non-linear equation and plotted using a 4d plot.

## Tensorflow High-Level API Network using Tensorflow Einsum
In this section I built a Tensorflow model using the high level tensorflow api. This 3-layer deep neural network will be using tensorflow's einsum instead of matrix multiplication in the forward method. A similar methodology will be used as in the low-level model (synthetically generated 3-dimensional data and 4-d plotting visual exploration and evaluation of the results)
